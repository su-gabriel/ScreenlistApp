#🎬 Screenlist – Your Personalized, Cross-Platform Watch Companion

Screenlist is an AI-powered web app that helps you discover what to watch next—across all your favorite streaming platforms. Think of it as Goodreads for movies and TV, customized to your tastes, mood, and viewing habits.

This project was built as part of the Master of Management program at the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary.

💡 Why Screenlist?

There’s more content than ever, yet finding something to watch still takes forever. Existing platforms only recommend titles within their own libraries, leading to decision fatigue and endless scrolling.

Screenlist is different.
It offers cross-platform recommendations, analyzes your viewing habits, and even gives you personality insights based on the content you love. It’s personal, smart, and fun.

🧠 How We Used AI

AI played a critical role from day one. We used it to:
	•	Brainstorm app names, descriptions, and features
	•	Write friendly, helpful UX copy
	•	Draft logic for recommendations and personality analysis
	•	Debug issues and iterate faster without a traditional coding background

Working with AI was an exercise in creativity, precision, and constant improvement.
